./J2V

*************************** other **********************************
- the maximum allowed size of an array is (2^32 - 1) / 4
  because an integer is 4 bytes in java and vapor is bounded by
  the maximum size of a word (also 4 bytes) when addressing 
  an offset into an array 
- note that (2^32 - 1) / 4  is greater then (2^31 - 1) (the max size
  of an unsigned int)

- redid parser to be more functional, and not uses classes
